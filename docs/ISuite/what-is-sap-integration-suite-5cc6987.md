# What is SAP Integration Suite?

Develop and manage enterprise wide integration across heterogeneous landscapes. 

SAP Integration Suite connects and contextualizes processes and data while enabling new content-rich applications to be assembled faster with less dependence on IT. Pre-built integration packs along with existing investments can be composed to deliver new outcomes with less involvement by integration experts.
